"Prove you knew it"

Told U So is an onchain predictions storage service providing mathematically indisputable evidence that you knew or thought something at a certain time. Predictions can be stored encrypted or unencrypted and can be shared in a way that makes it easy to prove to anyone that you knew something.

*Know something important but can't reveal it publicly?*  
*Store an encrypted message on the public blockchain*    
*Reveal it whenever you want.*
